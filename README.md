# skill-sync
SkillSync is a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing workshop bookings and one-on-one meetings
The system uses Firebase for authentication
and database management and integrates the Google Calendar API for scheduling. It
enables users to:
  1.​ Request meetings with mentors from a database.
  2.​ Schedule one-on-one sessions with peers.
  3.​ Ensure all bookings occur strictly during weekdays (Monday to Friday) between
  07:00 and 17:00.
